# PROJECT-SAP
The project is a marketing website called "Royal Scent".

It's a perfume store on which you add the desired items to 
a cart and check out the order. 

There is also an employee dashboard on which you manipulate the items via RPC API 
methods. 

To use the website you need to set up the database on your desired relational database management system and make a Stripe account from which you need  the public and secret key to test the checkout functionality.

After a successful register and login you go to the home menu and navigate by the given UI.
